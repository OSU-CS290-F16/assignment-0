<H1> What is your name? </H1>
Riley Brandau. I go by Riley.

<a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~brandaur/blog.html">My CS290 Blog </a>

<H1> My major and year of study </H1>
Computer Science. 5th year, I guess. I'm doing a post-bacc.

<H1> On a scale from 0 to 10, how condident are you in your web development skills? </H1>
Probably a 2 at the moment. The last time I wrote anything in HTML was in high school (2000-2004).

<H1> What do you hope to learn from this class? </H1>
I hope to learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope to learn how to create functional web pages and sitest hat I can use for personal and/or business uses.

<H1> Have you signed up for Piazza? </H1>
Yes!

<H1> An interesting fact or the most unique experience you've had? </H1>
Lets see... well, it took me until the age of 27 to get my first passport. The farthest West I had traveled was to Hawaii, and the farthest East was to New York (where I ended up breaking my ankle the first day I was there... hooray). But I have since traveled to the Dominican Republic (Punta Cana), and last year I traveled to Thailand. There are many more places that I'd like to see!
