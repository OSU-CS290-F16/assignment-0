<h2> Assignment 0: Challenges & Troubles </h2>
Learning how to use GitHub correctly is definitely a challenge. For instance, I started using it on the browser/desktop side, so the command line instructions were not very useful for me. Fearing that I wouldn't correctly 'push' my files to the hub was very concerning to me, so I decided to look into using git on FLIP. 
The other challenge I encountered was learning how to write a simple web page in html. I think I did what was required, but I doubt it will look pretty (as of writing this, I have not yet published my index page in the ENGR web space). I feel like my paragraphs/responses will not wrap or the spacing will be very odd.

I have had trouble connecting to the mysql page to reset my password. I've also had trouble connecting to see my node.js diagnostic page (ie https://access.engr.oregonstate.edu:xxxx where the xxxx is an unused port). Both pages simply wont connect. I have been logged into flip2 via PuTTY while attempting to load those pages, which I believe is what the instructions say to do. But as I go back, I realize I have not... D'oh.

Update: I erroneously thought that the VPN and PuTTY were the same. I am now able to see my mysql base page "It's working!" :)


<h2> Assignment 0: What I Learned </h2>
I have learned to read the instructions very carefully. If i'm encountering an error, it is probably because I missed a small detail somewhere. I learned that UNIX has a backup/restore feature (or maybe it's VIM?), as while I was writing this blog entry, I went back over the instructions and connected to OSU via a VPN, and PuTTY crashed. I had saved my blog before anything was lost, but it is nice to know that there is a recovery feature. I'm not sure how extensive it is though.

<h2> Assignment 0: What I Knew </h2>
This is all pretty much brand new to me! Although, I already knew how to connect to the school servers via PuTTY, as I've had to do that for my other programming classes.

<h2> Assignment 0: What Resources were helpful </h2>
I looked at the information provided in the assignment, and followed the github tutorial links in there. I looked on piazza, but hadn't yet encountered the problems those students have seen (as I have yet to upload my web pages). I encountered an annoying issue with VIM where hitting backspace produced ^? characters each time (to solve this I had to type "stty erase '^?'" but I am not sure that is a permanent fix), I did a google search and ended up at vim.wikia.com. I also had to look up the very basics of HTML code, which I got from help.websiteos.com/websiteos/example_of_a_simple_html_page.htm .
